					<h3 id="psychotherapy" style="color: #922869;">Psychotherapy</h3>
<p>
    Psychotherapy provides a particular type of enriched environment that can help individuals experiencing a wide array of emotional and relational challenges.
    Psychotherapy primarily does this by bringing awareness to the current impediments which are presenting in our client’s lives and relationships and which are causing distress and conflict thereby blocking individuals from having satisfying experiences and feeling emotional well-being.
    Psychotherapy explores these blocks often in the light of their roots in early relational experiences.
</p>
<p>
    It takes courage to explore the painful origins of our relational disturbances and requires a patience and commitment to work through these in order to become aware and then if we chose to, make lasting changes to our lives.
    The aim then is often for better functionality, and well-being, more satisfying relational experiences and long-lasting behavioural changes.
</p>
<p>
    We believe that it is the relationship with the therapist that holds the key to the exploration of these issues and considering this we endeavour to provide safe, enriched, supportive environments so that our clients can do so. 
    This environment is also challenging in nature as relational risk-taking is seen as a prerequisite for healing, growth and change to occur.
</p>
<p>Our team offers psychotherapy for adults, adolescents and couples.</p>

<h3 id="supervision" style="color: #922869;">Clinical Supervision</h3>
<p>
    Clinical supervision is a facilitated space for psychotherapists and other health care professionals to engage in honest, in-depth reflection about their clinical practice with an accredited Clinical Supervisor who is encouraging and supportive.
    Clinical supervision rests on the foundation of a relationship based on mutual respect, shared dedication to client welfare, co-created goals and methods, and the emotional safety necessary for sharing and processing the emotional intensity of counselling and psychotherapy.
</p>
<p>
    This formal process aims to enable the supervisee to achieve, sustain and creatively develop a high-quality practice through the means of focused support, learning and development.
    Our team offers both individual and group supervision, tailored specifically towards individual and group needs.
</p>

<h3 id="processgroups" style="color: #922869;">Advanced Therapeutic Process Groups</h3>

<h4>Purpose of the group</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of this experiential process group is to provide a space for practicing psychotherapists and individuals with a great deal of personal development to continue to develop their personal awareness and their relational skills through direct group experiential learning with particular focus on here-and-now relating.
</p>

<h4>Group ethos</h4>
<p>
    We aim to provide a group environment which offers the opportunity to meet others at relational depth in a here-and-now oriented context. 
    The beliefs underpinning this group are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>As human beings we are born relating, we acquire pain relationally and thus, we must also heal relationally.</li>
    <li>Each individual is responsible for their own healing and through encouragement, and gentle challenge can be supported to be more responsible for themselves.</li>
    <li>Personal learning, responsibility and insight can be achieved in a supportive, safe, group environment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>A note on process</h4>
<p>
    Process and content are separate entities. Content refers to what is spoken about explicitly, the words or expressions used to communicate.
    Process is concerned with meaning. It is concerned with what the explicit words and expressions, the style of the individual and the nature of the discussion tell us about the interpersonal relationships between individuals.
    Process essentially is concerned with the how and the why of communication as a gateway towards understanding individuals’ relating with others.
</p>

<h4>Entry requirements</h4>
<p>
    This group is open to accredited and pre-accredited therapists. Exceptions may be considered depending on individual levels of personal awareness and development.
    It is imperative that group members be open to risk-taking in terms of disclosure, and direct participation in the group experience. 
    This requires a capacity to both challenge others and be open to being challenged and to receiving feedback from the group.
</p>
<p>
    In order for the above to be achieved optimally, regular attendance is a pre-requisite.
</p>

<h3 id="workshops" style="color: #922869;">Experiential Personal Process Workshops</h3>
<p>
    Endeavour workshops offer an opportunity to participate in unique, creative, experiential groups where individuals can experience transformative healing in a supportive and nurturing environment.
    We invite participants to join us in our safe spaces where risk is encouraged in taking steps towards knowing your deeper, more authentic selves.
</p>
<p>
    A variety of workshops have been created to assist in delving into particular aspects of the psyche which may hitherto remain unexplored and unresolved, with the aim of furthering the journey of self-discovery.
    Our mainly residential, two-day workshops are highly experiential, combining group experience with music, dance, movement, expression, art and ritual.
    We employ Gestalt techniques to assist in developing awareness, and encouraging emotional healing and integration of mind, body, spirit.
</p>

<h4>Exploring core beliefs: Creating a path towards healing</h4>
<p>
    In this workshop we explore the Gestalt concept of ‘introjection’ which is a process whereby an opinion, an attitude, a belief or an instruction is unquestioningly taken in from the “other,” outside of ourselves as if it were true and gets swallowed whole without discernment.
    Introjecting is an avoidance of considering or chewing over the validity of the offered “introject”. The environment at the time of our early development required us to do this for our survival.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that these introjects remain within us as fixed beliefs long after we have survived the demands of our early environments and get stored in the unconscious.
    In this workshop we creatively bring these introjects into more conscious awareness. This process offers us a choice then on whether we wish to continue holding onto them, or whether we wish to undo them, replacing them with something more fittingly true in our current worlds.
</p>

<h4>The Hidden Self</h4>
<p>
    Many forces play a role in forming our hidden (Shadow) selves, ultimately determining what is permitted expression and what is not.
    Parents, siblings, teachers, clergy and friends create a complex environment in which we learn what is kind, proper, moral behaviour, and what is mean spirited, shameful and sinful. What falls into the shadow can vary depending on family, culture, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Developmentally we depended on our parents or main caregivers for survival—it was necessary for survival to attach to their way of doing things.
    For example, if a caretaker scolds you for being outspoken there is a chance that you won’t feel safe speaking your mind from that point on even as an adult.
</p>

<h4>Compassion</h4>
<p>
    Compassion literally means “to suffer together”. It is often defined as the feeling that arises when you are confronted with another’s suffering and feel motivated to relieve that suffering.
    Self-compassion involves acting the same way towards yourself when you are having a difficult time, fail, or notice something you don’t like about yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Compassion helps us to connect with ourselves more, with others, mend relationships and move forward while fostering emotional intelligence and well-being.
</p>
<p>
    In this workshop we will identify the messages, feelings or processes which are blocking our compassion for ourselves and others, which may be stopping us from having better relationships and living more wholehearted, fuller lives.
</p>

<h3 id="training" style="color: #922869;">Training</h3>
<p>
    Our team provides training workshops and seminars for small groups of psychotherapists and trainee psychotherapists in a variety of areas from advanced therapeutic skills to particular areas of clinical interest, for example, advanced therapeutic skills, attachment, neuroscience, trauma, Gestalt theory and techniques.
